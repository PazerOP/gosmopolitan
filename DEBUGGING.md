# ARM64 Cosmo Debugging Log

## Problem
Building Go programs for `GOOS=cosmo GOARCH=arm64` and running them on macOS ARM64 crashes with SIGSEGV (exit 139).

## Background
- APE binaries on macOS ARM64 use the APE loader (ape-m1.c)
- The loader provides a `Syslib` structure with Apple API function pointers
- Direct syscalls don't work on Apple Silicon - must use Syslib functions
- Host OS is passed in X3 (8 = XNU/macOS), Syslib pointer in X15

## Files Modified

### Assembly (`src/runtime/`)
- `rt0_cosmo_arm64.s` - Entry point, saves hostos/syslib from APE loader
- `sys_cosmo_arm64.s` - Syscall implementations with CHECK_DARWIN paths

### Go (`src/runtime/`)
- `os_cosmo_arm64.go` - ARM64-specific OS interface, Syslib structure
- `os_cosmo_arm64_m.go` - mOS struct with `waitsema uintptr` for semaphores
- `os_cosmo_arm64_sema.go` - semacreate/semasleep/semawakeup using dispatch_semaphore
- `os_cosmo_amd64_m.go` - mOS struct with `waitsema uint32` for futex (non-arm64)
- `os_cosmo.go` - Removed mOS struct (now in arch-specific files)
- `lock_futex.go` - Changed build constraint to exclude arm64
- `lock_sema.go` - Changed build constraint to include cosmo arm64

## Debug Exit Codes Used

| Code | Location | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| 50 | rt0_cosmo_arm64.s cosmo_init_ok | ✓ PASS |
| 60 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s mmap entry | ✓ PASS |
| 61 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s sched_getaffinity entry | ✓ PASS |
| 65 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s sched_getaffinity return | ✓ PASS |
| 66 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s nanotime1 entry | ✓ PASS |
| 67 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s after clock_gettime | ✓ PASS |
| 68 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s nanotime1 return | NOT TESTED |
| 70 | sys_cosmo_arm64.s dispatch_semaphore_create | ✗ NOT REACHED |

## Fixes Applied

### 1. mmap Darwin Path (FIXED)
**Problem**: mmap was using Linux flags and FP-relative addressing broke after stack manipulation.
**Fix**:
- Load all arguments BEFORE stack alignment
- Translate MAP_ANONYMOUS (0x20) to MAP_ANON (0x1000)
- Save args to aligned stack, reload before call

### 2. madvise Darwin Path (FIXED)
**Problem**: No CHECK_DARWIN, was making direct SVC syscall on macOS.
**Fix**: Added Darwin path returning 0 (success).

### 3. mincore Darwin Path (FIXED)
**Problem**: No CHECK_DARWIN, was making direct SVC syscall on macOS.
**Fix**: Added Darwin path returning -1.

### 4. Futex ENOSYS (PARTIALLY FIXED)
**Problem**: cosmo used lock_futex.go but futex doesn't exist on macOS (returns ENOSYS).
**Fix**:
- Switched cosmo arm64 to use lock_sema.go instead
- Implemented semaphore functions using dispatch_semaphore from Syslib
- Split mOS struct into arch-specific files (waitsema type differs)

**Status**: Implementation complete but crash still occurs before semaphore code is reached.

## Current State

The crash (SIGSEGV, exit 139) happens:
- AFTER: clock_gettime in nanotime1 (exit 67 works)
- BEFORE: dispatch_semaphore_create (exit 70 not reached)

This means the crash is in `schedinit` somewhere between:
- `ticks.init()` (calls nanotime, works)
- First lock contention (would call semacreate)

Likely crashing in one of:
- `moduledataverify()`
- `stackinit()`
- `randinit()`
- `mallocinit()`

## Next Steps

1. Add debug exit at `open` or `read` syscall (called by randinit for /dev/urandom)
2. Add debug in mallocinit path (second mmap call?)
3. Check if stack/frame handling is correct for Go function calls
4. Verify TLS setup is correct for cosmo (currently uses TLS_linux, not TLS_darwin)

## TLS Concern

The tls_arm64.h defines:
- `GOOS_cosmo` → `TLS_linux` → uses `TPIDR_EL0` (0xd53bd040)
- `GOOS_darwin` → `TLS_darwin` → uses `TPIDRRO_EL0` (0xd53bd060)

On macOS ARM64, the TLS base is in TPIDRRO_EL0, not TPIDR_EL0. This might cause issues when Go code tries to access TLS. However, for non-cgo builds, save_g/load_g are no-ops so this might not matter.

## Test Binary

```bash
cd test_build
GOOS=cosmo GOARCH=arm64 /path/to/gosmopolitan/bin/go build -o minimal_arm64.com minimal.go
./minimal_arm64.com
echo "Exit: $?"
```

minimal.go:
```go
package main

func main() {
    println("Hello from cosmo!")
}
```

## Current Status (2025-01-18)

### WORKING
- Basic ARM64 APE binaries run on macOS ARM64
- `println()` (built-in) works correctly
- Thread creation via pthread_create works
- GC initialization works (bgsweep, bgscavenge)

### NOT WORKING
- `fmt.Println()` and `os.Stdout.Write()` crash with SIGSYS
- Any syscall via the `syscall` package crashes on darwin ARM64

### Root Cause of Remaining Issue
The `internal/runtime/syscall/cosmo/asm_cosmo_arm64.s` uses raw `SVC` for all syscalls. This works on Linux but causes SIGSYS on darwin because macOS ARM64 doesn't allow raw syscalls.

The Go runtime works because `runtime/sys_cosmo_arm64.s` uses `CHECK_DARWIN` macros to route to syslib functions. But the `syscall` package uses the generic `cosmo.Syscall6` which doesn't know about syslib.

### Fix Required
Need to modify `internal/runtime/syscall/cosmo/asm_cosmo_arm64.s` to:
1. Check if running on darwin (`runtime·hostos == 8`)
2. Route to syslib functions for common syscalls (write, read, open, close, etc.)
3. This requires a syscall number → syslib offset mapping table

### Recent Fixes Applied
1. **clone_darwin**: Fixed FP-relative access after RSP modification - load mp before SUB $48, RSP
2. **mstart_stub_cosmo**: Simplified to match darwin's mstart_stub exactly
3. **mStackIsSystemAllocated**: Returns true for cosmo ARM64 (pthread provides stack)
4. **getpid**: Added CHECK_DARWIN path using syslib offset 112
5. **rlimit.go**: Skip rlimit adjustment on cosmo (workaround for syscall issue)
