# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Don't Ask Stupid Questions

When there's a specification, **follow the specification**. Never ask "should I follow the spec or do something different?" - the answer is always follow the spec. That's what specs are for. If the implementation doesn't match the spec, fix the implementation.

## Project Overview

This is a fork of the Go programming language toolchain that adds support for **Cosmopolitan Libc** (`GOOS=cosmo`). Cosmopolitan enables building "Actually Portable Executables" (APE) - single binaries that run natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows without modification.

## No Rosetta Dependency

**APE binaries run natively on all platforms without emulation.** This is not a goal or theory - it's proven, working technology. Real APE executables (like `vim.com` from Cosmopolitan) already run natively on x86_64 Linux, x86_64 macOS, ARM64 macOS, and Windows today without Rosetta.

- APE binaries contain native code for multiple architectures (AMD64 + ARM64)
- On ARM64 macOS, APE runs native ARM64 code - NOT x86_64 via Rosetta
- The cosmocc toolchain doesn't need Rosetta, neither do we
- If something "works via Rosetta", that's not actually working - it's a bug

When building/testing:
- `GOARCH=amd64` produces x86_64 code only - will NOT work natively on ARM64 macOS
- Full APE support requires both AMD64 and ARM64 code paths
- Runtime must detect host OS/arch and use appropriate syscall method

**macOS syscall restriction**: macOS (both x86_64 and ARM64) does not allow raw syscalls. All syscalls must go through Apple's frameworks via the `syslib` function pointer table. Code that uses raw `SYSCALL`/`SVC` instructions will crash with SIGSYS on macOS.

## Build Commands

Build from the `src/` directory. Requires a Go 1.24+ bootstrap toolchain (set `GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP` or have `go` in PATH).

```bash
# Build the toolchain (Unix)
cd src && ./make.bash

# Build the toolchain (Windows)
cd src && make.bat

# Build and run all tests
cd src && ./all.bash

# Run tests only (after build)
cd src && ./run.bash
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests in test/ directory
go test cmd/internal/testdir

# Run specific test files
go test cmd/internal/testdir -run='Test/(file1.go|file2.go)'

# Run compiler package tests
go test ./cmd/compile/...

# Run standard library tests
go test std
```

## Building Cosmopolitan Binaries

```bash
# Build an APE binary
GOOS=cosmo GOARCH=amd64 go build -o program.com main.go
```

The resulting `.com` file runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Architecture

### Compiler Pipeline (`src/cmd/compile/`)

The compiler has 7 phases:
1. **Parsing** (`internal/syntax`) - lexer, parser, syntax tree
2. **Type checking** (`internal/types2`) - type analysis
3. **IR construction** (`internal/ir`, `internal/noder`) - convert to compiler AST
4. **Middle end** (`internal/inline`, `internal/escape`) - inlining, escape analysis
5. **Walk** (`internal/walk`) - desugar high-level constructs
6. **SSA** (`internal/ssa`, `internal/ssagen`) - optimization passes
7. **Code generation** (`cmd/internal/obj`) - machine code output

### Cosmopolitan-Specific Code

Runtime support for `GOOS=cosmo` is in `src/runtime/`:
- `os_cosmo.go` - main OS interface (thread creation, signals)
- `mem_cosmo.go` - memory management
- `netpoll_cosmo.go` - network polling
- `signal_cosmo_amd64.go` - signal handling
- `defs_cosmo_amd64.go` - system constants

Syscall layer: `src/internal/runtime/syscall/cosmo/`

### Key Directories

- `src/cmd/` - toolchain commands (compile, link, go, etc.)
- `src/runtime/` - Go runtime implementation
- `src/` - standard library packages
- `test/` - compiler and runtime test suite

## Debugging Tips

```bash
# View optimization info (inlining, escape analysis)
go build -gcflags=-m=2

# Generate SSA visualization for a function
GOSSAFUNC=FunctionName go build

# Print assembly output
go build -gcflags=-S

# Compiler timing
go tool compile -bench=out.txt file.go
```

## CI

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/cosmo-ci.yml`) builds the toolchain and tests that APE binaries built on any platform (Linux/macOS/Windows) run correctly on all other platforms.

## Adding Cosmo Support to Standard Library Packages

When a stdlib package fails to build for `GOOS=cosmo`, follow these steps:

### 1. Identify Build Constraint Types

Go uses two types of build constraints:
- **`//go:build` directives** - Add `cosmo` to the constraint (e.g., `//go:build cosmo || linux || ...`)
- **Filename suffixes** - Files like `foo_linux.go` only build for Linux. Create `foo_cosmo.go` with equivalent functionality.

### 2. Check What Cosmo Already Has

Before creating new files, check existing cosmo implementations:
```bash
ls src/**/\*cosmo\*.go
grep -r "//go:build.*cosmo" src/
```

### 3. Runtime Platform Handling

Cosmopolitan binaries run on Linux, macOS, AND Windows at runtime. When creating `_cosmo.go` files:
- Don't assume Linux-only features like `/proc` are available
- Cosmopolitan Libc translates Linux syscalls to native OS calls at runtime
- Test assumptions about what works on each platform

### 4. Syscall Wrappers

The `syscall` package uses `//sys` comments to generate wrappers. Check:
- `src/syscall/syscall_cosmo.go` - main syscall implementations
- `src/syscall/zsyscall_cosmo_amd64.go` - generated syscall stubs

If a function like `Listen` is defined as lowercase `listen` but callers expect uppercase `Listen`, add a wrapper:
```go
func Listen(s int, backlog int) (err error) {
    return listen(s, backlog)
}
```

### 5. Common Patterns

When adding cosmo to an existing `//go:build` constraint, use alphabetical order:
```go
//go:build cosmo || dragonfly || freebsd || linux  // cosmo first alphabetically
```

For filename-based constraints, create new files rather than modifying the build system.

## Debugging ARM64 Cosmo

**Keep `DEBUGGING.md` updated** when working on ARM64 cosmo support. Log:
- What you've tried (with debug exit codes used)
- What worked vs what failed
- Current hypothesis and next steps

This prevents going in circles and losing context across sessions.

## APE Binary Reference

**GOAL: Make our APE binaries work exactly like `~/Downloads/vim.com`**

The vim.com binary is a working APE that runs on macOS ARM64. When fixing APE generation:
1. Compare our output to vim.com's shell header structure
2. Match vim.com's macOS ARM64 handling (embedded APE loader, cc compilation)
3. Don't invent new approaches - copy what works in vim.com
