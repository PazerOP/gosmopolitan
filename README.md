# Gosmopolitan

This is an **experimental fork** of the [Go programming language](https://github.com/golang/go) that adds support for building **Actually Portable Executables (APE)** using [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan).

## What are APE binaries?

APE binaries are single executables that run natively on multiple operating systems—Linux, macOS, and Windows—without modification or recompilation. Build once, run anywhere.

## Building APE Binaries

```bash
GOOS=cosmo GOARCH=amd64 go build -o program.com main.go
```

The resulting `.com` file runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Building the Toolchain

Build from the `src/` directory. Requires a Go 1.24+ bootstrap toolchain.

```bash
cd src && ./make.bash    # Unix
cd src && make.bat       # Windows
```

## Status

This is an experimental project. Use at your own risk.
